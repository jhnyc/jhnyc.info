# jhnyc.info
[jhnyc.info](https://jhnyc.info/) is my personal site where I display basic information about myself and dabble with fun & cool UI tricks.

## Data
To separate the data from the UI, I put the data on `npoint.io`. The website will just fetch the data from the those endpoints so I don't need to go into the codebase to make changes to the data.
- [Readme](https://www.npoint.io/docs/06e31b267b975ffe0133): information for the `readme.txt` file
- [Projects](https://www.npoint.io/docs/44e1bf1c2d438b7038ad): some of the projects I've done
- [Directory](https://www.npoint.io/docs/d74175eda2ddc2771b5a): to control the directory structure of the UI
- [Command Output](https://www.npoint.io/docs/47dec9c20428ad573779): to simulate simple terminal commands. Try `cmatrix` with the terminal :D
